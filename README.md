## Project Description

A **CLI-based tool for WebSocket Load Testing** will be developed to address the current gap in the ecosystem for a robust and maintained alternative to existing HTTP-focused or unmaintained WebSocket load testing solutions. This tool aims to simplify quick load testing of WebSocket endpoints without requiring complex scripting.

* **Problem Statement:**
    * Lack of a well-maintained, dedicated CLI tool for WebSocket load testing.
    * Existing alternatives like Bombardier are primarily HTTP-focused.
    * Mjolnir, a past alternative, is unmaintained and effectively dead.
    * Current solutions often require writing complex scripts (e.g., k6) for quick tests.

* **Solution:**
    * Develop a new, dedicated CLI tool specifically for WebSocket load testing.
    * Provide a straightforward and efficient way to perform quick load tests.

* **Technology Stack:**
    * **Language:** Golang (chosen for its excellent packages and suitability for such tools).

* **Key Benefits & Goals:**
    * Offer a robust and actively maintained alternative in the load testing ecosystem.
    * Eliminate the need for writing extensive scripts for basic WebSocket load testing scenarios.
    * Simplify the process of assessing WebSocket endpoint performance under load.
